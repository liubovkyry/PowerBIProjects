In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority.
In this project were analyzed attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. 

## Healthcare Analysis with Power BI
To kick off I brought the data into Power BI and connect data model. 
After a quick check-up on the dataset content, I got started with some initial exploratory analytics. 
Then, I leveraged some of my DAX skills to create calculated measures and columns.

<!--### Measuring Hospital efficiency

Length of stay (or LOS) is considered an important indicator of the efficiency of hospital management. It's calculated as the total duration in days for a patient stay in hospital. A shorter LOS is often desirable in hospital operations. Primarily, shorter LOS means costs can be lowered. Reducing LOS can also release capacity in the system and improve throughput, enabling hospitals to serve more patients. Many factors can impact LOS. Patient age, health status, the type of procedure (or surgery), whether or not there were any complications, and the size of the hospital are some common factors.

## Analyzing Hospital Performance and Benchmarking

Roll up your sleeves and scrub in—it’s time to get operating on some insights! This chapter is all about identifying hospital performance outliers and revealing what attributes most influence length of stay and cost per patient discharge. Along the way, you’ll sharpen your DAX skills by building some more complex measures and calculated tables.

## Creating a dynamic dashboard
In this final chapter, you’ll focus on building your final dashboard into a cohesive and interactive report. You’ll incorporate the HealthStat branding for an appealing display, optimize user-friendly navigation features, and close off by adding a dynamic title. -->

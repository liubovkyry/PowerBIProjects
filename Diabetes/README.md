Patients with Diabetes Profile Analysis 
Project Objectives
We all have experienced at least once in our life being in the hospital or at the hospital.
That is why I decided to analyze patients’ demographic and patients’ data about health with a focus on effectiveness of the provided treatment in defined time (up to 14 days being admitted).
The Data
The data set can be found on Kaggle and represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care data from 130 US hospitals throughout the United States: Midwest (18 hospitals), Northeast (58), South (28), and West (16).

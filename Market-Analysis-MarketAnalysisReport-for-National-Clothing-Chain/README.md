# Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain



An online national clothing chain needs a help in creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales
have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. 
They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they don’t know who to target. 

### Tasks:
 - using
population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around
the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income.
 - to conduct an
analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer. 
  
 -  predict customers' income by looking at their purchase history and locations
and comparing that against the census data. 
 - to analyze our inventory, specifically
customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two.
